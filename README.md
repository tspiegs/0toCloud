This is a easy way for beginners to automatically startup a cloud server

CURRENTLY UBUNTU ONLY!

Running the startup script will (after a few more commits):
  1.  Download Terraform
  2.  Unzip terraform download into your path
  3.  Ask for your DigitalOcean API Key
  4.  setup a small DigitalOcean Dropley
  5.  give you an IP address that you should be able to reach via SSH

More to come.
